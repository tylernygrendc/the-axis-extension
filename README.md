# The AXIS Extension

AXIS is the combined heath record and customer management system utilized by [The Joint Chiropractic](https://www.thejoint.com/our-story). This project is intended to simplify and extend AXIS features, enhancing the user experience and increasing employee productivity. Successful grassroots adoption of this system has the potential to improve both the patient and employee experience on a national scale.
